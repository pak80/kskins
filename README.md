Some alternate maps &amp; skins for ksirk

        https://www.kde.org/applications/games/ksirk/

These are intended primarily to provide different maps (networks)
to play the game on, because I got bored with the original World Map.
They are not intended to provide elegant graphics, and the maps
themselves are simple randomly coloured discs connected by arrows.


On my linux system the skins are either placed in my home directory:

$HOME/.kde/share/apps/ksirk/skins

or in the system location:

/usr/share/apps/ksirk/skins

SOLSTAR

by pak80 2017, 2018

A non-standard map/skin for ksirk, loosely representing the network of 
habitable stars within a 20 light year neighbourhood of our \n Sun. It 
is based on the map that can be found at

http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/starmaps/mapindex.php 

but I have added an extra link via "Wormspace" between two start to 
improve play. It is in my default abstract (disk/arrow) visual style.
